# Terminal Applications

There are some pretty cool terminal applications that I installed with `brew`. I have these separate from the [Developer](/Developer.md) section as they aren't relevant for most people.

## Web

Being able to view websites in your terminal is a pretty surreal experience. I personally really like `w3m`. A classic option that I haven't used to much is `lynx`.

## Email

Ever thought you could view your email in your terminal? Probably not! Meet `mutt`!

## Window Manager

I already mentioned this in the [Developer](/Developer.md), but `tmux` is a great terminal multiplexer.
