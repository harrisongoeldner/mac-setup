# Email Client

Since I started using macOS, choosing an email Client has been a struggle. There are so many options yet many of them suck or are simply too limiting. In the end I chose Thunderbird. Below is a list of what I've tried in order of which I like the most. I'll expand more in the future.

1. Thunderbird
2. Spark
3. Mail
4. Mailspring
5. Newton
6. Canary
7. eM Client

## Thunderbird Setup

To get thunderbird to work efficiently, you need to install a couple add-ons. (To be added)
