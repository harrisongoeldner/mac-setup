# Ebook Management

The best way to manage your Ebooks is using a tool called [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/). It is compatible with Kindle, Kobo, and a whole slu of other products. The reason it is so much more powerful that the default Kindle or Kobo desktop application is that it isn't locked into any ecosystem. You can convert any file format and even remove the DRMs (with the help of a plugin) from ebooks.

*Note: Removing DRMs is a illegal in some jurisdictions. In addition, the file that the DRM is removed from should never be used for piracy. Use this guide at your own risk.*

It is important to keep in mind that I use macOS and a Kindle. This guide can still be used for other scenarios, but some of the plugins I use are Kindle specific.

## Installation 

Although Calibre can be installed using the link on the website, I prefer using a package manager. As I am on macOS, I prefer to use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). With Brew installed, this can be achieved by running:

> brew install --cask calibre
